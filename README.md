What is SecurityOnion?

Security Onion is a host and network based intrustion detection/prevention solution that includes log management and analysis. 
It can either be a physical device in your network or it can be a virtual machine. 

How does Security Onion work (in a nutshell)?

The SO must be able to collect your network traffic via a SPAN or Mirror port on a switch. 
That traffic is ingested by your SO and you can then use the built in dashboard, events, and Kibana platform to investigate.
